# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard (Power BI Project)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard** using **Power BI** to visualize patient health data and uncover insights related to survival rates, age impact, and medical indicators such as serum creatinine, ejection fraction, diabetes, anaemia, and high blood pressure.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal is to identify **patterns and risk factors** in heart disease cases by:
- Tracking survival rates across age groups
- Visualizing medical metrics (serum creatinine, ejection fraction)
- Analyzing the impact of lifestyle and medical conditions (smoking, diabetes, etc.)
- Supporting healthcare professionals in data-driven decision making


## 📌 Key Features

✔️ **Survival Rate & Total Deaths Visualization**  
✔️ **Average Age of Survival Calculation**  
✔️ **Survival Count by Age Group**  
✔️ **Serum Creatinine & Ejection Fraction by Age**  
✔️ **Risk Factor Impact (Smoking, Diabetes, Anaemia, BP)**  
✔️ **Gender-based filtering for comparison**  
✔️ Clean, interactive, and responsive layout using Power BI visuals


## 📂 Dataset Information

- 📁 File: `Heart_Disease_Dataset.xlsx`  
- 🎲 Columns: Age, Gender, Serum Creatinine, Ejection Fraction, Anaemia, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Smoking, Death Event, etc.  
- 🧮 Total Records: 299 patients  
- 📌 Source: Public heart disease dataset (from Kaggle/UCI or similar)


## 📊 Visuals Included

- Bar Charts with Lines (for average medical metrics)
- Area Charts (for survival rate trends)
- Ribbon Charts (for risk factor impacts)
- Card visuals (for KPIs: survival rate, avg age, total deaths)
- Slicers (for gender filtering)

## 💡 Insights Discovered

- Patients **above 70** have the **lowest survival rate** (~40%)  
- **Average serum creatinine** peaks in the **71+ age group**  
- **Smoking and high blood pressure** are significant across all age groups  
- Most survivors are aged **40–70**, with highest survival seen in **61–70**

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- DAX (for KPI calculations)
- Excel (for preprocessing)
